Predicting Next Day's Rain in Australia
     This project involves building a predictive model to forecast the next day's rain using a dataset containing 10 years of daily weather observations from various locations across Australia.

*Project Overview*
With a comprehensive dataset that includes weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more, we aim to create a reliable model that can predict whether it will rain the next day. The project covers the entire data science pipeline from data preprocessing to model evaluation.

*Key Features*
 Data Preprocessing:
   Handling missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   Visualizing and understanding the data distributions and relationships.
 Model Building:
   Implementing various machine learning algorithms to predict rainfall.
 Model Evaluation: 
   Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
 Deployment: 
   Creating a user-friendly interface for making predictions.
